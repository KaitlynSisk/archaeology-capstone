When driving through the Fourth Ward of Houston today, one can still see pieces of the history of Freedman's Town, the community founded by free African-Americans in the 19th century, scattered between modern houses and downtown Houston's skyrise. Called the "mother ward" of the African-American community in Houston, Freedman's Town is the only remaining post-Civil War, freed slave community of its kind in the United States and therefore provides valuable insight into the lives of urban African-American communities post Emancipation. With few written sources of the history of Freedman's Town, one of the ways to reconstruct the history and identities of the community is through looking at the material remains of households, such as glass, ceramics, and animal remains, that can reveal patterns of consumption.

Just as the things we purchase today can help in building our different identities, the inhabitants of Freedman's Town made choices about the things they consumed that created identities in their social contexts. Post-emancipation urban historical archaeology from around the United States has shown that there is no set pattern of African-American consumption; people of many different socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicities made choices to resist and to conform to social conventions and beliefs of their time. The inhabitants of Freedman's Town were no different.

This project looks at consumption patterns across three sites in Freedman's Town: the Yates House, built by local businessman Rutherford B. H. Yates; the house of J. Vance Lewis, a prominent African-American lawyer; and the Wilson-Victor property, upon which a general store, a barbershop, and a house once stood. By looking at what the community members of Freedman's Town left behind, we can evaluate their consumer choices to try to reconstruct identities and social contexts.
