#Consumption and Class

After Emancipation, a new middle class that now included African Americans began to rise. With more opportunties to participate in the consumer market and to create businesses of their own, a new brand of African American gentility began to form. Though many African Americans participating in this racist post-Emancipation market found ways to show resistance, some also took part in popular consumer activities as a means to show their status. 

Ceramic analysis in the archaeological record can reveal much about the socioeconomic status and consumption practices of a site's inhabitants. One common show of status common in households in the United States is the presence of fine ceramics such as porcelain. Research done in the historic [New Philadelphia, Illinois](http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/NP/index.html), a multiethnic community founded by a free African American in the 19th century, shows that families throughout the community participated in drinking tea from a variety of differently priced ceramic tea wares. Even though these tea vessels varied, there was no evidence that they were used any differently in white households than in African American households. Tea drinking was a widespread practice during the Victorian era, but archaeological research in Lowell, Massachusetts has shown that ceramic assemblages between middle-class and working-class households were quite similar aside from tea and coffee wares. Having a fine tea set was seen as a mark of status and wealth for families all over the United States, including in Freedman's Town.

###Taking Tea

Many of the households in Freedman's Town used fine ceramic teaware to take their tea, showing that at least some of the families in the community were able to afford these luxury items. Excavations at 1312 Ruthven revealed many fragments of teacup handles and saucers, many with a decorative scalloped edge. A relatively high amount of porcelain was found at Ruthven site, which could mean that this household was particularly wealthy. 

Rutherford B. H. Yates and his family enjoyed taking tea at their home too. Twelve teacup handles - six china and six whiteware, a less expensive ceramic - were discovered in excavations. Many of the fragments of tea saucers and tea cups were discovered in one particular area of the backyard. It is possible that the occupants of this home enjoyed drinking their tea outside and had a particular area designated to the ritual of taking tea. 

Along with the tea handles, one single sherd of Egyptian black basalt pottery was also found on the Yates' property. This kind of pottery is almost exclusively used in tea wares such as teapots, sugar bowls, and other ornamental tea equipage and likely added to the inhabitants' mismatched collection of tea equipage. As with many African American middle class families around the United States, the Yates family had tea cups of many different decorations and styles. Instead of buying a complete set, they collected vessels one by one, building a complete set over time. Their set even included teacups for their children. Despite the mismatched tea sets, the Yates family, and many families in Freedman's Town, could afford to take their tea in style.
