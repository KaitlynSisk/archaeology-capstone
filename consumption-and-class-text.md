New Philadelphia

* Had been shown in NYC that Victorian upper class families had expensive ceramic tea wares and lower-class families had cheaper, ironstone tea wares
* participated in tea drinking, although with less expensive ceramics

Ceramic assemblages of working-class and middle-class households in 19th and 20th century Lowell, massachusetts were “remarkably similar” aside from their collections of tea- and coffee-ware
