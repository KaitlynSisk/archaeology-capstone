###About the project

All data was collected through the [Rice University Archaeological Field Techniques classes'](http://freedmanstownarchaeology.rice.edu/index.html) spring excavations in Freedman's Town between 2008-2013 through the collaboration with the [Yates Museum] (http://www.yatesmuseum.org/) and the (Community Archaeology Research Institute)[http://www.publicarchaeology.org/CARI/).

This project was created by Kaitlyn Sisk to satisfy the capstone requirement for a degree in anthropology from Rice University.
