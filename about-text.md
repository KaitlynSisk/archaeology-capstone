###About the project

This project was created by Kaitlyn Sisk to satisfy the capstone requirement for a degree in anthropology from Rice University. All data was collected through the [Rice University Archaeological Field Techniques classes'](http://freedmanstownarchaeology.rice.edu/index.html) spring excavations in Freedman's Town between 2008-2013 through the collaboration with the [Yates Museum] (http://www.yatesmuseum.org/) and the [Community Archaeology Research Institute](http://www.publicarchaeology.org/CARI/). Although many excavations have taken place in Freedman's Town over the past few years, the data has yet to be pulled together and comprehensively analyzed on a larger scale. This project is not only an attempt to see how consumption patterns in Freedman's Town compare to other urban sites across the United States, but also a way to share a part of the history of this significant town with current residents of the Fourth Ward, the Rice community, and the greater Houston area.
