<h3><a id="about">About the project</a></h3>

This project was created by Kaitlyn Sisk as a capstone project for her major in Anthropology from Rice University. All data was collected through the [Rice University Archaeological Field Techniques classes'](http://freedmanstownarchaeology.rice.edu/index.html) spring excavations in Freedman's Town between 2008-2013 through the collaboration with the [Yates Museum] (http://www.yatesmuseum.org/) and the [Community Archaeology Research Institute](http://www.publicarchaeology.org/CARI/). Although many excavations have taken place in Freedman's Town over the past few years, the data has yet to be pulled together and comprehensively analyzed on a larger scale. This project is not only an attempt to see how consumption patterns in Freedman's Town compare to other urban sites across the United States, but also a way to share a part of the history of this significant town with current residents of the Fourth Ward, the Rice community, and the greater Houston area. 

<h3><a id="community">Community Archaeology in Freedman's Town</a></h3>

In 1984, Freedman's Town was designated as a national historic district. Despite this, only 30 registered historic properties remain of the original 530 sites. The Rutherford B. H. Yates museum strives to preserve the remaining historic sites, to collect and reconstruct the history of Freedman's Town, and to reach out to the community to facilitate education about the community. 

The Yates Museum has been the primary sponsor of the Yates Community Archaeology Program (YCAP) since 2001 and is currently the home of the YCAP historical archaeology lab.
