#Consumption as Resistance

Even though urban African Americans enjoyed popular pasttimes through consumer culture, many also found ways to use this consumer culture as resistance to racist ideas and economic markets. Archaeological excavations in different neighborhoods of Annaopolis, Maryland revealed that African Americans often chose to consume nationally branded goods as opposed to locally produced goods, likely to avoid the racism of local producers. Buying brands ensured consistent quality of goods, fair prices, and uncontaminated product that were often difficult to acquire in the local market. 

This pattern of brand consumption was not limited to a certain class or economic group. Homes in working-class and middle-class neighborhoods in Annapolis contained many nationally produced bottles, cans, and jars. These houses also had a shortage of fish remains and preservation jars in the archaeological record, likely because of the racialized caricatures of African Americans in public discourse at the time associated with these items. The resistance to racism was shared between members of different classes in Annapolis.

###Brand Consumption in Freedman's Town

Freedman's Town paints a bit of a different picture than Annapolis, Maryland. The Fourth Ward was a hub for African American businesses and culture in Houston, and findings from archaeologists Feit and Jones show that members of the Fourth Ward community likely relied on goods produced locally. Excavations done by Rice University have also discovered numerous bottles, jars, and other containers that suggest brand consumption. Archaeological materials found in Freedman's Town reveal that community members participated in numerous economic spheres, potentially for numerous reasons. 

Like in Annapolis, there was a shortage of Mason jars and other preserving jars used in home processing discovered in Freedman's Town, which means that families would have had to rely on local markets to buy everyday goods. However, a few Mason jars were unearthed at some of the sites in Freedman's Town, including at the Wilson-Victor site, showing that families occasionally participated in preserving their own foods. 

The Archaeological record at Freedman's Town included some well-known national brands as well. The Yates family, at one point, seasoned their food with Heinz ketchup and enjoyed an ice cold bottle of America's favorite soda, Coca-Cola. Similarly, the occupants at 1312 Ruthven
