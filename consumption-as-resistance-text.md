<h1><a id="top">Consumption as Resistance</a></h1>

Even though urban African Americans were able to enjoy popular pastimes through consumer culture in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, many also found ways to use this consumer culture as resistance to racism. [Archaeological excavations](http://www.aia.umd.edu/index.html) at the housese of African Americans in Annapolis, Maryland revealed data that suggests that they often chose to consume nationally-branded goods as opposed to those produced locally as a way to avoid the racism of local producers. Buying brands ensured consistent quality of goods, fair prices, and uncontaminated product that were often difficult to acquire in the local market. 

This pattern of brand consumption was not limited to a certain class or economic group. Homes in working-class and middle-class neighborhoods in Annapolis, such as from the [Maynard-Burgess House](http://www.aia.umd.edu/maynard.html), contained many nationally produced bottles, cans, and jars. These houses also had a shortage of preservation jars in the archaeological record, likely because of the racialized caricatures of African Americans in public discourse at the time associated with these items. The resistance to racism was shared between members of different classes in Annapolis.

<h3><a id="brand">Brand Consumption in Freedman's Town</a></h3>

Evidence at Freedman's Town paints a slightly different picture than at Annapolis, Maryland. The Fourth Ward was a hub for African American businesses and culture in Houston, and findings from archaeologists Rachel Feit and B. M. Jones show that members of the Fourth Ward community likely relied on goods produced locally. Excavations done by Rice University have also discovered numerous bottles, jars, and other containers that suggest brand consumption. Archaeological materials found in Freedman's Town reveal that community members participated in numerous economic spheres, potentially for a variety of reasons. 

Like in Annapolis, archaeological excavations in Freedman's Town revealed few Mason jars and other preserving jars used in home processing. This may suggest that families relied on local markets to buy everyday goods. However, a few Mason jars were unearthed at some of the sites in Freedman's Town, including at the Wilson-Victor site, showing that families occasionally participated in preserving their own foods. Other goods, though, were likely purchased from local stores, such as the one that once stood at the corner of Wilson and Victor Streets. Because it was located just across the street from the Gregory School, it is easy to imagine children visiting the store after school to buy some ice cream or a cold soda. 

However, the archaeological record at Freedman's Town included some well-known national brands as well. The Yates family, at one point, seasoned their food with Heinz ketchup and enjoyed an ice cold bottle of Coca-Cola. Similarly, the occupants at 1312 Ruthven had a jar of Vaseline at their home that could be used for many purposes. Other sites contained remains of candy wrappers, but it is difficult to tell whether inhabitants of Freedman's Town participated in brand consumption for the same reasons as African Americans in Annapolis. 

Many of the inhabitants of Freedman's Town were part of multiple markets outside their local one. Ceramics found at the Rutherford B. H. Yates house were discovered to have come from great distances away from Freedman's Town, showing that the Yates family participated in wide ranging economic spheres. J. Vance Lewis and his family were able to acquire goods from outside of Houston, too. A bottle of Gebhardt Eagle Sauce, made by the Gebhardt Chili Powder Company in New Braunsfels, Texas, was unearthed at the J. Vance Lewis site. Whether this well-known sauce was given to the family as a gift or purchased locally, the Lewis family consumed items produced outside of Houston.
