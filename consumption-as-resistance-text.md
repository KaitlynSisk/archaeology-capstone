#Consumption as Resistance

Even though urban African Americans enjoyed popular pasttimes through consumer culture, many also found ways to use this consumer culture as resistance to racist ideas and economic markets. Archaeological excavations in different neighborhoods of Annaopolis, Maryland revealed that African Americans often chose to consume nationally branded goods as opposed to locally produced goods, likely to avoid the racism of local producers. Buying brands ensured consistent quality of goods, fair prices, and uncontaminated product that were often difficult to acquire in the local market. 

This pattern of brand consumption was not limited to a certain class or economic group. Homes in working-class and middle-class neighborhoods in Annapolis contained many nationally produced bottles, cans, and jars. These houses also had a shortage of fish remains and preservation jars in the archaeological record, likely because of the racialized caricatures of African Americans in public discourse at the time associated with these items. The resistance to racism was shared between members of different classes in Annapolis.

###Brand Consumption in Freedman's Town

Freedman's Town paints a bit of a different picture than Annapolis, Maryland. The Fourth Ward was a hub for African American businesses and culture in Houston, and findings from archaeologists Feit and Jones show that members of the Fourth Ward community likely relied on goods produced locally. Excavations done by Rice University have also discovered numerous bottles, jars, and other containers that suggest brand consumption. Archaeological materials found in Freedman's Town reveal that community members participated in numerous economic spheres, potentially for a variety of reasons. 

Like in Annapolis, there was a shortage of Mason jars and other preserving jars used in home processing discovered in Freedman's Town, which means that families would have had to rely on local markets to buy everyday goods. However, a few Mason jars were unearthed at some of the sites in Freedman's Town, including at the Wilson-Victor site, showing that families occasionally participated in preserving their own foods. Other goods, though, were likely purchased from local stores, such as the one that once stood at the corner of Wilson and Victor. Because it was located just across the street from the Gregory School, it is easy to imagine children visiting the store after school to buy some ice cream or a cold soda. 

The archaeological record at Freedman's Town included some well-known national brands as well. The Yates family, at one point, seasoned their food with Heinz ketchup and enjoyed an ice cold bottle of America's favorite soda, Coca-Cola. Similarly, the occupants at 1312 Ruthven had a jar of Vaseline at their home that could be used for many purposes. Other sites contained remains of candy wrappers, but it is difficult to tell whether inhabitants of Freedman's Town participated in brand consumption for the same reasons as African Americans in Annapolis. 

Many of the inhabitants of Freedman's Town were part of more markets than just their local one. Ceramics found at the Rutherford B. H. Yates house were discovered to have come from great distances away from Freedman's Town, showing that the Yates family participated in wide ranging economic spheres. J. Vance Lewis and his family were able to acquire goods from outside of Houston, too. A bottle of Gebhardt Eagle Sauce, made by the Gebhardt Chili Powder Company in New Braunsfels, Texas, was unearthed at the J. Vance Lewis site.
