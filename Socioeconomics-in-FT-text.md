#Socioeconomics in Freedman's Town

Despite that numerous studies about African American archaeology focus on what sets African American communities apart, much of the contents of urban archaeological assemblages in the United States is the same no matter the ethnicity of the inhabitants. In fact, researchers at [New Philadelphia](http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/NP/history.html) found that it was often difficult to tell an African American home from a white European settler's home based on archaeological remains alone. Differences in assemblages were more prevalent between houses of different classes and socioeconomic standings. Within a multi-ethnic, working-class neighborhood, the archaeological record shows that the inhabitants came from varying socioeconomic backgrounds. 

One way that archaeologists can roughly determine the socioeconomic status of the inhabitants at a site is the presence of different cuts of professionally butchered meats. Finding bones from short loin and sirloin cuts of beef could indicate that a family could afford higher quality cuts of meat, at least occasionally. An abundance of lower quality cuts of beef and pork, such as shank cuts used in stews, is an indication that a family was probably of a lower socioeconomic status. Looking at the frequency of bones of different animals and different cuts, combined with an analysis of other artifacts such as ceramics, can give a sense of the socioeconomic status of the inhabitants of a site. 

###The Yates House

In lower levels, have lower quality meat cuts, but the more recent levels have high quality cuts - grew in socioeconomic status over time (butchered long bones of cow in lower levels and sirloin and short loin in abundance in higher levels)

Had mostly cow and pig bones, all parts of pigs were eaten

Also has expensive cuts with lower cuts - wealthy enough to afford high quality meat occasionally

Combined with expensive porcelain and dolls, this household was probably fairly wealthy

###The J. Vance Lewis House

Seems to have a variety of high quality cuts and medium/low value cuts 

###The Wilson-Victor Property

###Freedman's Town

* according to Feit, residents of project area had typical diet for a Texas urban site - cows and pigs
* most sites had a majority of butchered meats, so likely little butchering was done on site.
* Difficult to tell economic status from small sampling in excavations, but can get a sense.
* sheep, deer, and fish also consumed by residents 
* across all sites, cow, pig, and deer consumed most commonly
* Freedman’s town residents were buying expensive cuts of meat as well as eating economical cuts of meat
* Yates’ residence enjoyed a wider variety of meat, while others relied primarily upon cow and pig
