#Socioeconomics in Freedman's Town

Despite that numerous studies about African American archaeology focus on what sets African American communities apart, much of the contents of urban archaeological assemblages in the United States is the same no matter the ethnicity of the inhabitants. In fact, researchers at [New Philadelphia](http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/NP/history.html) found that it was often difficult to tell an African American home from a white European settler's home based on archaeological remains alone. Differences in assemblages were more prevalent between houses of different classes and socioeconomic standings. Within a multi-ethnic, working-class neighborhood, the archaeological record shows that the inhabitants came from varying socioeconomic backgrounds. 

One way that archaeologists can roughly determine the socioeconomic status of the inhabitants at a site is the presence of different cuts of professionally butchered meats. Combined with an analysis of other artifacts such as ceramics, 

###The Yates House

In lower levels, have lower quality meat cuts, but the more recent levels have high quality cuts - grew in socioeconomic status over time

Combined with expensive porcelain and dolls, this household was probably fairly wealthy

###The J. Vance Lewis House

###The Wilson-Victor Property

###Freedman's Town
