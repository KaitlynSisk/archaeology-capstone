#History

The Fourth Ward of Houston was given the nickname "Freedman's Town" during the aftermath of the Civil War, when freed African Americans settled in the area to find job opportunities in the growing metropolis. After Emancipation, over a thousand free African Americans migrated to Houston and bought cheap, undesirable, and swampy properties in the Fourth Ward. This led to an influx in population. In 1900, the Fourth Ward contained 14,608 inhabitants, and that number grew to 30,000 by 1915. By 1920, the Fourth Ward contained a third of Houston's population. 

Interestingly, the Fourth Ward remained a diverse neighborhood well into the 20th century, until the racial segregation so common in the American South permeated through Houston. In fact, African Americans were not a majority in the Fourth Ward until 1915. By 1929, though, realtors had unofficially and illegally segregated housing by designating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th wards of Houston as black neighborhoods.

Despite the racism in Houston, Freedman's Town was a center of African American culture, entrepreneurship, and life. For example, even in its earliest days, Freedman's Town had remarkable rates of home ownership. Former slaves in Freedman's Town were already able to buy their own homes just five years after emancipation. By the turn of the twentieth century, over 12% of African Americans owned their own homes, and on average, African Americans held onto their property for twenty years. This showed not only the economic success of African American families at the time, but the cultural significance of businesses, schools, and churches in the community. The Rutherford B. H. Yates House, the J. Vance Lewis House, and the Wilson-Victor property are examples of the cultural significance of Freedman's Town.

###The Rutherford B. H. Yates House

John Henry (Jack) Yates, the father of Rutherford B. H. Yates, was the first pastor of Antioch Baptist Church in Freedman's Town and an important community leader. It is because of Yates that home ownership was so prevalent in Freedman's Town, as he assisted incoming families with legal processes and encouraging people in his congregation to purchase their homes. His own two-story home was the first of its kind owned by an African-American, and now resides at [Sam Houston Park](http://www.heritagesociety.org/yates.html). 

Yates' son, Rutherford, had a home next door of his own at 1314 Andrews. One of four of Jack Yates' children to earn a degree, Rutherford set up a printing business called the Yates Printing Business of Houston and wrote a book about the successes of his father. His home has been restored and reclaimed as the [Rutherford B. H. Yates Museum](http://www.publicarchaeology.org/yates/index.html), a place to study and learn about the history of Freedman's Town.

###The J. Vance Lewis House

Located at 1218 Wilson Street, the J. Vance Lewis House belonged to a prominent lawyer in Freedman's Town. The property originally belonged to Isabella Simms, who bought the land in 1874 for $80. Lewis acquired the property through his wife and tore down the original house in 1907 to build the one that currently stands at 1218 Wilson. Dubbed "Van Court" by Lewis, the house was built by L. R. Jones for $2,800.

###The Wilson-Victor Property

The property at the At one point had three different buildings on it: a store, a barber shop, and a home

In the 1920s, two african american barbers, James Williams and Earl T. Randon, owned the home/barbershop. 1950s owned by Flossie Davies and Faye Tarver.

Although the corner store on the Wilson-Victor property was owned by Italian immigrants, Freedman's Town was an important hub for African-American entrepreneurship. In 1910, around 32% of African-American owned businesses were located in the Fourth Ward. 

Shotgun house still remains, hopes for it to be restored and turned into a barbershop museum.
