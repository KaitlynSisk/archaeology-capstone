wards divided after election of Houston's first mayor in 1837, 

Free African Americans wanted to be near the city of Houston because of the many job opportunities, so the Fourth Ward, which was on the outskirts of the city at the time, was a perfect place to move.  In 1900, Freedman's Town contained 14,608 inhabitants, and that number grew to 30,000 by 1915. By 1920, Freedman's Town contained a third of Houston's population. 

Interestingly, however, the Fourth Ward remained a diverse neighborhood well into the 20th century, until the racial segregation so common throughout the American South permeated through Houston. In fact, African Americans were not a  majority in the Fourth Ward until 1915. By 1929, though, realtors had unofficially and illegally segregated housing by designating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th wards as black.

gained nickname of "Freedman's Town" - some African Americans were able to gain ownership of small parcels of land during the 1860s

Freedman's Town had remarkable rates of home ownership. Former slaves in Freedman's Town were already able to buy their own homes just five years after emancipation. By the turn of the twentieth century, over 12% of African Americans owned their own homes, and on average, African Americans held onto their property for twenty years. The Yates family is an example of a family with strong roots in Freedman's Town.

Property riginally belonged to Isabella Simms, who bought the property for $80 in 1874. Lewis came to own it through his wife. Current house was built in 1907 by L. R. Jones for $2,800 after demolishing old house 

###The Wilson-Victor Property

At one point had three different buildings on it: a store, a barber shop, and a home

In the 1920s, two african american barbers, James Williams and Earl T. Randon, owned the home/barbershop. 1950s owned by Flossie Davies and Faye Tarver.

Although the corner store on the Wilson-Victor property was owned by Italian immigrants, Freedman's Town was an important hub for African-American entrepreneurship. In 1910, around 32% of African-American owned businesses were located in the Fourth Ward.
